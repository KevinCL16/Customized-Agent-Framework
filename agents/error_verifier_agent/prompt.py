DEPRECATE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''You will be provided with an original query and a data analysis code. Your task is to:

1. Determine whether the code has any errors in its data analysis process
2. Determine which **error type** from the list below is in the provided code. 
3. **Explain** the error, including:
   - **Explanation**: Explain why this is an error and what issues it may cause.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Explain how this error will affect the data analysis results, such as misleading outcomes, degraded performance, or incorrect interpretations.

### List of Common Error Types:
1. **Algorithm Choice Mismatch**: Using a regression algorithm for classification tasks or a classification algorithm for regression tasks.
2. **Evaluation Metric Mismatch**: Using inappropriate metrics to evaluate model performance.
3. **Handling Categorical Features Incorrectly**: Misusing or incorrectly encoding categorical features.
4. **Data Normalization Issue**: Not normalizing numerical features before using algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales.
5. **Random State Consistency**: Not setting a consistent `random_state`, resulting in non-reproducible results.
6. **Incorrect Interpretation of Output**: Misinterpreting the output of a regression model for classification or not converting outputs to an appropriate form.
7. **Data Leakage**: Applying data transformations (such as scaling or encoding) before splitting into training and testing sets, leading to overly optimistic model performance.
8. **Ignoring Data Imbalance**: Not accounting for class imbalance in the dataset, resulting in misleading performance metrics.
9. **Poor Outcome Visualization**: Inadequate or misleading visualizations that make it difficult to understand model behavior or errors.
10. **Feature Correlation Issues**: Ignoring correlations between features, leading to multicollinearity problems in linear models.

   - **Expected Outcome**: How this error will affect the analysis results, such as producing misleading conclusions or performance degradation.

### List of Common Error Types:
1. **Algorithm Choice Mismatch**: Using regression algorithms for classification tasks, or vice versa.
2. **Evaluation Metric Mismatch**: Inappropriate metrics to measure performance.
3. **Handling Categorical Features Incorrectly**: Issues in encoding or misusing categorical data.
4. **Data Normalization Issue**: Lack of feature scaling when required by specific algorithms.
5. **Random State Consistency**: Not ensuring reproducible results through a fixed random state.
6. **Incorrect Interpretation of Output**: Misinterpreting model outputs or predictions.
7. **Data Leakage**: Applying transformations before the train-test split.
8. **Ignoring Data Imbalance**: Failing to address class imbalance in datasets.
9. **Poor Outcome Visualization**: Inadequate or misleading visualizations.
